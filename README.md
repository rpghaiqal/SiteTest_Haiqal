<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Shopify Testing Theme]](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/focal/styles/carbon)

A theme controls the organization, features, and style of your online store. Different themes have different styles and layouts, and offer a different experience for your customers. For example, if you're selling spa products, then you might want your online store to feel relaxed and luxurious. If you're selling electronics, then you might want your online store to look energetic and sleek.

You can customize your theme settings from your Shopify admin by using the theme editor. If your theme doesn't have a setting for a change that you want to make, then you can edit your theme code.
